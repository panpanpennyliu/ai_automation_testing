To merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet, follow these detailed steps based on the current state shown in the image:

1. **Select the Cells to Merge**:
   - Click and drag to select the cells in the first row that you want to merge. For example, if you want to merge cells A1, B1, and C1, click on cell A1 and drag to cell C1.

2. **Open the Merge Options**:
   - After selecting the cells, look for the "Merge & Center" option in the toolbar. This is usually found in the "Home" tab of the ribbon at the top of the Excel window.

3. **Choose the Merge Type**:
   - Click on the "Merge & Center" dropdown arrow to see the merge options. You can choose:
     - **Merge & Center**: Merges the selected cells and centers the content.
     - **Merge Across**: Merges cells in each row individually (not applicable if you are merging a single row).
     - **Merge Cells**: Merges the selected cells without centering the content.
     - **Unmerge Cells**: If you need to unmerge previously merged cells.

4. **Confirm the Merge**:
   - Click on your desired merge option (e.g., "Merge & Center"). The selected cells will now be merged into one cell.

5. **Adjust Formatting (if needed)**:
   - After merging, you may want to adjust the font size, style, or alignment of the text in the merged cell to ensure it looks the way you want.

By following these steps, you will successfully merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet.

In the provided frames, the prompt box with a red background and white text containing the words "<左键>" appears **five times**. Each occurrence represents a left-click event.
It looks like the image shows an Excel spreadsheet with the number "123" appearing multiple times in different cells. To analyze the number of times "123" appears, you can follow these steps in Excel:

1. **Select the Range**: Highlight the range of cells you want to search through.
2. **Use the COUNTIF Function**: In a new cell, enter the formula `=COUNTIF(A1:Z100, "123")`, adjusting the range (A1:Z100) as necessary to cover all relevant cells.
3. **Press Enter**: This will give you the total count of how many times "123" appears in the selected range.
