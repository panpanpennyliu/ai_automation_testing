 Here are the detailed steps from the video based on the frames provided:

1. **Open Weather Website**: The operator opens a weather website displaying the current temperature and weather conditions.
  
2. **View Temperature**: The temperature is displayed prominently on the website, showing the current temperature for a specific city.

3. **Spreadsheet Opened**: The operator has a spreadsheet open on the right side, with column A ready to receive city names and column B for temperatures.

4. **Select City**: The operator selects a city from the spreadsheet (column A).

5. **Search for Temperature**: The operator enters the city name into the weather website's search bar and initiates the search.

6. **View Results**: The website displays the current temperature and weather conditions for the searched city.

7. **Record Temperature**: The operator notes the temperature displayed on the website.

8. **Fill Spreadsheet**: The operator enters the recorded temperature into the corresponding cell in column B of the spreadsheet.

9. **Repeat Process**: The operator returns to the spreadsheet, selects the next city from column A, and repeats the search and recording process.

10. **Continue Until Complete**: This process continues for each city listed in column A, with temperatures being recorded in column B until all cities have been processed.

11. **Final Review**: Once all temperatures are recorded, the operator may review the spreadsheet for accuracy.

12. **Save Spreadsheet**: The operator saves the spreadsheet with the recorded temperatures for future reference. 

This sequence captures the main actions taken in the video.

 To get the weather temperature for "Yunnan" following the steps shown in the video, you can follow these instructions:

1. **Open a Web Browser**: Start by launching your preferred web browser.

2. **Search for Weather**: In the search bar, type "Yunnan weather" and press Enter. This should lead you to a weather website that provides current weather information.

3. **Locate the Temperature**: Once the weather page for Yunnan loads, look for the current temperature displayed prominently on the page. It is usually shown in large numbers at the top.

4. **Record the Temperature**: Note down the temperature. If there are multiple readings (like high and low), make sure to record the one you need.

5. **Open Your Spreadsheet**: Switch to your spreadsheet application (like Google Sheets or Excel).

6. **Input the Temperature**: Click on the cell where you want to enter the temperature and type in the value you noted from the weather website.

7. **Repeat if Necessary**: If you need to check the weather for other locations, repeat the steps above for each location.

By following these steps, you can efficiently gather and record the weather temperature for Yunnan or any other city.

 To merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet, follow these detailed steps based on the current state shown in the image:

1. **Select the Cells to Merge**:
   - Click and drag to select the cells in the first row that you want to merge. For example, if you want to merge cells A1, B1, and C1, click on cell A1 and drag to cell C1.

2. **Open the Merge Options**:
   - After selecting the cells, look for the "Merge & Center" option in the toolbar. This is usually found in the "Home" tab of the ribbon at the top of the Excel window.

3. **Choose the Merge Type**:
   - Click on the "Merge & Center" dropdown arrow to see the merge options. You can choose:
     - **Merge & Center**: Merges the selected cells and centers the content.
     - **Merge Across**: Merges cells in each row individually (not applicable if you are merging a single row).
     - **Merge Cells**: Merges the selected cells without centering the content.
     - **Unmerge Cells**: If you need to unmerge previously merged cells.

4. **Confirm the Merge**:
   - Click on your desired merge option (e.g., "Merge & Center"). The selected cells will now be merged into one cell.

5. **Adjust Formatting (if needed)**:
   - After merging, you may want to adjust the font size, style, or alignment of the text in the merged cell to ensure it looks the way you want.

By following these steps, you will successfully merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet.

 It looks like the image shows an Excel spreadsheet with the number "123" appearing multiple times in different cells. To analyze the number of times "123" appears, you can follow these steps in Excel:

1. **Select the Range**: Highlight the range of cells you want to search through.
2. **Use the COUNTIF Function**: In a new cell, enter the formula `=COUNTIF(A1:Z100, "123")`, adjusting the range (A1:Z100) as necessary to cover all relevant cells.
3. **Press Enter**: This will give you the total count of how many times "123" appears in the selected range.
