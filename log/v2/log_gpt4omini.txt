 Here are the detailed steps from the video based on the frames provided:

1. **Open Weather Website**: The operator opens a weather website displaying the current temperature and weather conditions.

2. **View Temperature**: The current temperature is displayed prominently on the website.

3. **Check Weather Details**: The operator reviews additional weather details such as forecasts and conditions.

4. **Open Spreadsheet**: The operator switches to a spreadsheet application where they have a list of cities in column A.

5. **Select First City**: The operator selects the first city from column A in the spreadsheet.

6. **Search for City Temperature**: The operator enters the name of the selected city into the weather website's search bar.

7. **View Temperature Result**: The operator waits for the website to load and displays the temperature for the searched city.

8. **Record Temperature**: The operator notes the temperature displayed on the website.

9. **Fill Spreadsheet**: The operator enters the recorded temperature into column B of the spreadsheet next to the corresponding city.

10. **Repeat Process**: The operator repeats steps 5 to 9 for the next city in column A, searching for its temperature and recording it in column B.

11. **Continue Until Complete**: The operator continues this process for all cities listed in column A until all temperatures are recorded in column B.

12. **Final Review**: The operator reviews the spreadsheet to ensure all temperatures have been accurately recorded.

13. **Save Spreadsheet**: The operator saves the updated spreadsheet with the recorded temperatures.

These steps outline the process of searching for city temperatures and recording them in a spreadsheet as shown in the video frames.

 It looks like you've shared a series of frames from a video showing the process of retrieving weather data for various cities and entering that information into an Excel sheet. 

To summarize the process based on the frames:

1. **Open Weather Website**: The user navigates to a weather website to check the temperature for a specific city.
2. **Retrieve Temperature**: The temperature is displayed prominently on the website.
3. **Enter Data into Excel**: The user enters the city name and corresponding temperature into an Excel sheet.
4. **Repeat for Other Cities**: This process is repeated for multiple cities, with the user switching back and forth between the weather website and the Excel sheet.

If you need a specific table format for the city names and temperatures, please provide the city names and their corresponding temperatures, and I can help format that into a table.

 To merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet, follow these detailed steps based on the current state shown in the image:

1. **Select the Cells to Merge**:
   - Click and drag to select the cells in the first row that you want to merge. For example, if you want to merge cells A1, B1, and C1, click on cell A1 and drag to cell C1.

2. **Open the Merge Options**:
   - After selecting the cells, look for the "Merge & Center" button in the toolbar. This is usually found in the "Home" tab of the ribbon at the top of the Excel window.

3. **Choose the Merge Option**:
   - Click on the "Merge & Center" button. If you want to see more options, click the small arrow next to it. You will see options like:
     - **Merge & Center**: Merges the selected cells and centers the content.
     - **Merge Across**: Merges cells in each row individually.
     - **Merge Cells**: Merges the selected cells without centering the content.
     - **Unmerge Cells**: If you want to unmerge any previously merged cells.

4. **Confirm the Merge**:
   - After selecting your desired merge option, the cells will merge, and the content from the top-left cell (A1) will remain, while the content from the other cells will be removed.

5. **Adjust Formatting (if needed)**:
   - You may want to adjust the font size, style, or alignment of the merged cell to fit your needs.

By following these steps, you will successfully merge the first row in your Excel spreadsheet.

 It looks like the image shows an Excel spreadsheet with the number "123" appearing multiple times in different cells. To analyze the number of times "123" appears, you can follow these steps in Excel:

1. **Select the Range**: Highlight the range of cells you want to search through.
2. **Use the COUNTIF Function**: In a new cell, enter the formula `=COUNTIF(A1:Z100, "123")`, adjusting the range (A1:Z100) as necessary to cover all relevant cells.
3. **Press Enter**: This will give you the total count of how many times "123" appears in the selected range.

If you need further assistance with Excel functions or any specific analysis, feel free to ask!
